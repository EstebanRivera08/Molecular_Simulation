If you want to explore in detail talk to someone in the teaching team for an explanation. The KS test measures vertical separation between integrated distribution functions as a measure of the 'distance' between two distributions. The KS test is in [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ks_2samp.html)."
