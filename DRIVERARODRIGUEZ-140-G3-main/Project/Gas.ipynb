    "We wish to study the pressure of the hard disk system as a function of the density. van der Waals proposed a simple equation of state which improves on the perfect gas law $PV=Nk_BT$, where $P$ is the pressure, $V$ the volume $T$ temperature and $N$ number of particles. For particles with only repulsive interactions, like the hard disk system he proposed $P(V/N-b) = k_B T$. Study the pressure of a hard sphere system as a function of $N$ and $V$, can you extract a value for the volume correction $b$. How well does the van der Walls expression work? Does it break down in certain limits?"

    "You will need to initialize the state of the system for different average densities, what is the best strategy for placing $N$ particles in a box? To get reasonable results $N$ should be neither too small, where systematic errors creep in, nor too large when then dynamics becomes slow due to the simple algorithms that we are using."
